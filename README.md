# Sewing in the sun

Beautiful sunny weather on a weekend along with the self-isolation due to COVID-19 inspires to spend all day long in the garden... 

...sewing the robot. 
Project Duncan, for some known as SourceCowD, robotic cow that will host upcoming coding tutorials Youtube channel is one of alternative ideas to complete till next year on final dissertation. Scottish cow plush toy - hand warmer is doomed to become my Frankenstein Mooster. Although in its final form the system will involve cloud/local AI , raspberry Pi with voice and image recognition, every journey has to start with first steps. 
Sunny, relaxed weekend filled was thus with undoing original stitches of Duncan, in order to allow to insert microservos and Arduino mocrocontroller inside the toy and to protrude the motoric rigging from the main body. Prior to this "surgery" hands were sawn in such a way that there was no sleeve leading through inside. Operation changed his hands into tubular sleeves ready for inserting robotic rigging. Then just for fun effect i programmed one servo so waving Duncan may say industry standard "Hello World!". Now, tutorial video footage will  definitely offer more dynamic , concerning the show's host. :)
